== Java 8 required

The required Java Runtime Environment (JRE) to run an Eclipse Scout application has changed: Starting with Eclipse Scout _Photon_, a Java 8 (or newer) runtime is required.

== New SDK Feature in Eclipse: Search for missing NLS keys

If NLS keys are used in the code that do not exist in a properties file, an ugly placeholder is displayed to the user. To find such missing translations the new Menu `Scout -> Search missing text keys...` may be handy.
The result is listed in the Eclipse `Search` view.

The search also takes the scope of each NLS key into account. So that the key is considered to be available there must be a `TextProviderService` with that key on the classpath of that module.

Reported false positives can be suppressed using the following comment at the end of the corresponding line: `NO-NLS-CHECK`. Matches on that line are then not reported in future searches anymore.


== Descriptions for Config Properties

Config properties based on `org.eclipse.scout.rt.platform.config.IConfigProperty` include a description text. This description is stored in the new `description()` method.

The class `org.eclipse.scout.rt.platform.config.ConfigDescriptionExporter` can be used to export these descriptions. By default an AsciiDoctor exporter is included.

All Scout properties have been extended with descriptions. The same text is also part of the technical documentation.
